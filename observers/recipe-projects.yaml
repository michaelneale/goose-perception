  Identify projects/initiatives from ~/.local/share/goose-perception/: LATEST_WORK.md, INTERACTIONS.md, CONTRIBUTIONS.md
  Supplement with ~/.local/share/goose/sessions (recent jsonl, last/first ~1000 chars, careful - large files)
  Update PROJECTS.md: Inflight projects, brief descriptions/names. Append limited log of work timing. Keep current, not too large, limit old entries.
  Multiple projects OK. Ensure really current. Clarify WORK.md last paragraph if needed.
  
  ⚠️ Cross-check accuracy. If unsure = don't mention in PROJECTS.md.
  ⚠️ NEVER mention goose-perception. NOT work. Don't report automation.
  ⚠️ CHECK attribution. Cross-check code/docs/interactions. Don't confuse email lists/Slack broadcasts with activity.
