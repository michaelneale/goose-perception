    please look in /tmp/screenshots for txt files which are timestamped descriptions of what the user was looking at on their ~/.local/share/goose-perception/INTERACTIONS.md

    each timestamped txt file will contain: 
      * "Open Windows" which is really a list of apps (names of apps and perhaps documents or projects) open
      * "Screen N" sections
        - each screen section may have an AI description of what it thinks was on the screen (just high level or a guess)
        - each screen section will have "OCR Text" which is an approximate OCR of visible text. 

    Screens may be large so you may see them in quarters. 

    Content example of the file:

      === Open Windows ===
        app: doc, Other App: some info (more info) - thing, and so on

    There will be multiple files timestamped. You can look at most recent ones, go back looking for a sample of what apps, themes, projects, communication, people etc you can see
    Note what changes throughout the time, special attention to changes, and possibly what is recurring and in focus or important.

    these will be in chronological order, so you can see what they were doing at different times
    you can sample throughout the day, maybe once per hour if there are many files (if there are only less than 10, you can read them all), and look for some changes in that time.
    it is important you note the timestamp of the file
    your aim is to form a picture of what they are working on, and pay attention to changes and note and summarize them
    The user is working on various projects so you are to summarize work going on as best you can, you can try to guess the project names being worked on from the context as more is revealed.
    if any screens are for chat or email pay attention to the people being communicated with and topics
    note what documents or files, directories, docs etc  they are working on 
    a document, or an editor, will typically be associated with a project or some past work you can look up. 
    note any interesting objects/visuals you see in case they are need to be searched for later
    any key phrases or terms you see can also be noted.
    Note down any people interacted with you can see

    Please also look at windows that are open titles to consider things.

    Produce a very short report of what you see
