  GH CLI: Past week GitHub contributions, PRs reviewed. Check ~/.local/share/goose-perception/WORK.md for PR mentions.
  Google Drive: Docs edited/commented on.
  Summarize: Themes, repos/projects, metrics.
  
  ⚠️ NEVER mention goose-perception project. NOT work. Don't report automation.
  ⚠️ CHECK attribution - cross-check code/docs/interactions. User really did it. Don't confuse email lists/Slack broadcasts with activity.
  Remove irrelevant info from CONTRIBUTIONS.md.
  
  Save/append: ~/.local/share/goose-perception/CONTRIBUTIONS.md (can grow)
