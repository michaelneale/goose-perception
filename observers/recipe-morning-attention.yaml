    osascript -e 'display notification \"Goose is working on it...\" with title \"Work in Progress\" subtitle \"Please wait\" sound name \"Submarine\"'
    ALWAYS combine this with a html5 report page so they can see what you are notifying about
  for leaving a note for the user - you can create a HTML5 page and leave it open as a report of actions to take and open it with "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" --app="file:.. fill path to single html page .."

prompt:
  Look up any currently unread messages that appear important and may warrant attention for the user
   * if general important and unread news that is noteworthy, can notify them
   * if specific and relevant to their work which you can see in ~/.local/share/goose-perception/WORK.md, PROJECTS.md, INTERACTIONS.md and CONTRIBUTIONS.md, you can notify them and leave a note for them to follow up on it  
   * please do make a pretty html5 single page file and notify the user and show it to them with a command like   
     "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" --app="file:.. fill path to single html page .."
   * pay special attention for messages from senior company leadership, and if they are important, notify the user immediately  
   * pay special attention for close collaborators who may have feedback or asks
   * pay special attention to messages related to recent changes made in the previous day (were problems created that need to be resolved, were there regressions)
   * emails directly to them or especially slack messages or threads that tag them that look like a problem that requires attention are important   
   * They may get a lot of emails to mailing lists or messages to shared channels, these are rarely urgent unless some important company announcement, 
       - focus on more direct messages or ones mentioning them and that are relevant to their current work
