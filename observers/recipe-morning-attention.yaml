instructions: |
  Look at recent communications and messages that may be important for the user's attention
  for notifications: 
    osascript -e 'display notification \"Goose is working on it...\" with title \"Work in Progress\" subtitle \"Please wait\" sound name \"Submarine\"'
    ALWAYS combine this with a html5 report page so they can see what you are notifying about
  for leaving a note for the user - you can create a HTML5 page and leave it open as a report of actions to take and open it with "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" --app="file:.. fill path to single html page .."

  Find important unread messages needing attention. Check context: ~/.local/share/goose-perception/ WORK.md, PROJECTS.md, INTERACTIONS.md, CONTRIBUTIONS.md
  
  Create HTML5 report, notify & show: "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" --app="file:..path.."
  
  **PRIORITY ATTENTION:**
  • Senior leadership messages → notify immediately if important
  • Close collaborators → feedback/asks
  • Recent changes (yesterday) → problems/regressions needing resolution
  • Direct emails/Slack tags → problems requiring attention
  
  **FOCUS:** Direct messages or ones mentioning them + relevant to current work. Ignore mailing lists/shared channels unless urgent company announcements.
