  see if you can work out who the user has interacted with recently and make a summary of it in ~/.local/share/goose-perception/INTERACTIONS.md
  include what topics were discussed and themes

  include a brief section at the end which summarizes their communication preferences, do they use email, slack, will they email to larger groups or slack to a room with status updates, or are they more private
  learn their style and summarize it briefly so we can refer to that later, especially when they are formally communicating, are they wordy or brief, funny or not etc.
