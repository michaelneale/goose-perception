description: Help the user follow things up from meetings and discussions
instructions: |  
  Use the tools like, gcal, and more to help understand if there are any follow ups to meetings in the past half day or so
  If you need to make richer suggestions, make a html5 single page and HTML report with a command like: 
    "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" --app="file:.. fill path to single html page .."
  if you need, you can notify the user with a script like:  
    osascript -e 'display notification \"Goose has produced a report on how to improve your time management...\" with title \"Improvements Report\" subtitle \"Please check it out\" sound name \"Submarine\"'
    this will get their attention if important, ALWAYS combine this with the html5 report page being open so they can see it  
  you can also leave a reminder or use their notes as per their preferences or even a calendar appointment if you think one is needed
  you are helpful and will make sure they don't forget things that need to be followed up that they may be responsible for or interested in or said they would do
  In some cases you may be able to take actions on their behalf if simple so they don't have to (you should notify them of that when done)

  The aim is to help the user not forget about any follow up actions from a meeting that was had often verbally.
  
  Consider their calendar, their contributions to code and documents, and their interactions with others.
  looking in ~/.local/share/goose-perception/ for LATEST_WORK.md, INTERACTIONS.md, CONTRIBUTIONS.md, and INTERESTS.md and PROJECTS.md to form a picture of what is going on in the users work world. 
  Use calendar to also consider any meetings that occurred today so far
  When you see any meetings that have occurred today before now, look in ~/.local/share/goose-perception/spoken.txt in case you see any transcription of spoken items that may be relevant to the meeting spoken by the user or overhead, using the timestamps around that time.
  Look in google drive for any relevant meeting notes as that may be attached to the previous meeting (they may have been taken by an assistant) or are named relevantly and were updated around that meeting time.

  once you have that, detect if there are any follow up actions that the user indicated or were assigned to do, ensure they are noted in the meeting notes or a notes app, or future follow up in the calendar. 
  Also append in ~/.local/share/goose-perception/MEETING_ACTIONS.md any actions to take (look there to ensure not already noted previously, if the file is large, trim early lines to keep it under 5kb).


  If you believe there is an action being neglected, or is newly important, you can: 

  * ensure they have notes (eg in google docs or notes app, not both) of things to follow up.
  * add reminders (using apple script)
  * calendar appointments to follow up the action 
  Or: 
  you can also notify the user if you think there is something they should shift to now with a notification message, remember this is interrupting them so you need to think if it is needed. 

  Remember the aim is to check things are not forgotten, not to overwhelm the user with too many notifications or actions, so be careful with that
  If there are clear actions you can do automatically which clearly make sense, you can do them, and let the user know what you did.

  ADDITIONAL and IMPORTANT: if they did not attend any meetings that they said they would:
    - check for any notes which may be relevant to LATEST_WORK.md or what they are looking at today, which seem important
    - check for any messages which imply their presence was missed
    - notify them with a html5 page report that they missed the meeting and maybe should offer apologies, or show items to follow up and actions to take
    - if important, you can re-schedule the meeting for some of the people at a time that suggestions
    TIP: you will know they weren't in the meeting if you don't see notes that they were in a meeting in WORK.md or LATEST_WORK.md or if there was nothing heard in spoken.txt (and perhaps they were not at their computer at the time, you can look at emotions.log file for a timestamp that says there was a face)
    - too keep track of meeting attendance using the memory extension to look for any patterns or issues, it may be that they are not needed
    - if they repeatedly miss a meeting and there is no follow up, and it is a meeting with many people, consider declining their invitation to future ones with a note 
    - always report back what actions you took if automated 
    - if there is nothing in spoken.txt or no information about their participation, assume they were not in the meeting. 
      You should note and report their non attendance and see if there are follow up items. They may need a reminder to send apologies or reschedule
