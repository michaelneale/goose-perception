  Set up the required directory structure for goose-perception.
  
  Your task is to:
  1. Create the main goose-perception data directory: ~/.local/share/goose-perception
  2. Create subdirectories for automated actions: automated-actions/daily and automated-actions/weekly
  3. Create directory for adapted observers: adapted-observers
  4. Create screenshots directory: /tmp/screenshots
  5. Copy .goosehints file to the appropriate subdirectories
  6. Log the setup completion to the activity log
  
  Use these commands:
  - `mkdir -p ~/.local/share/goose-perception`
  - `mkdir -p ~/.local/share/goose-perception/automated-actions/daily`
  - `mkdir -p ~/.local/share/goose-perception/automated-actions/weekly` 
  - `mkdir -p ~/.local/share/goose-perception/adapted-observers`
  - `mkdir -p /tmp/screenshots`
  
  If observers/.goosehints exists, copy it to:
  - ~/.local/share/goose-perception/automated-actions/daily/.goosehints
  - ~/.local/share/goose-perception/automated-actions/weekly/.goosehints
  - ~/.local/share/goose-perception/adapted-observers/.goosehints
  
  Log the completion with timestamp to ~/.local/share/goose-perception/ACTIVITY-LOG.md:
  `echo "**$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')**: Directory setup completed" >> ~/.local/share/goose-perception/ACTIVITY-LOG.md`
  
  This recipe should run quickly and only log essential setup actions.
