description: start fixing in response to a message
instructions: |
  Look at unread messages that are new, perhaps help is needed or a failure
  for leaving a note for the user - you can create a HTML5 page and leave it open as a report of actions to take and open it with "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" --app="file:.. fill path to single html page .."  
  If they are a notes app user you can leave notes for them there with what you are working on (make it clear and brief)
  if actions are required from the user, you can leave reminders as well 
  there may be large quantities of data in notes or files so be careful what you include 
  use the memory extension to remember what you have been working on the past (add to it, and look it up) as you have worked on it and before starting something new, important you use that to keep track
  Be careful to cross reference data with other sources for accuracy

prompt:
  in the  ~/.local/share/goose-perception/ directory please consult the following
     LATEST_WORK.md PROJECTS.md INTERACTIONS.md and CONTRIBUTIONS.md to form a picture of what the user has been working on. 
  You can also consider WORK.md for a more full log

  based on this, if there are any messages which are clearly requiring some change to recent submitted work, and the user has recently worked on in WORK.md (but are not currently working on in LATEST_WORK.md)
  
  Consider LATEST_WORK.md if they are actually working on it now notify them that there is something relevant. 
  If it is something not active but has been worked on, you can notify them but if you can act on it, do so, go and make the corrections, make notes (propose changes) 

  IMPORTANT only do this if the user is inactive for some time and has indicated in a note that it is ok to go off and solve things.

  Pay special attention to if the message is clearly from a build failure, document feedback requesting changes and so on.
  it is IMPORTANT you don't make descriptive changes, so if it is code, then it should be a new branch, pull request, if a document, then can be a copy, or just comments back or change tracking.  
  notify them as you go working on it, and at the end open a html5 page with a neat summary of what you did (and also add to the ACTIVITY-LOG.md file in ~/.local/share/goose-perception/)

  TIP if the user is inactive, it is a good time to be proactive. If they user is actively working in that are, consider just notifying them vs working over the top of their changes
  IMPORTANT that you work in a separate directory to what the user has been working in based on what you see in LATEST_WORK.md, so that you don't overwrite their work  

  For example
    if code was recently pushed to github, a build failure may result, this can possibly be acted on if the code is checked out locally in another branch (or you can make a clone in a tmp dir from that branch and work on a fix on a new PR)
    if a document was recently edited in google drive, then you can make a copy of it and add comments or change tracking to it and act on the changes (or if clearly can be fixed in place, you can do that as a suggestion if you can)
  IMPORTANT work in ~/.local/share/goose-perception/fixing/ dir on copies of files or checkouts, unless the user has made it clear to work on something that they already have in another location 
  (we want to avoid over writing things that are already in progress by the user)
  IMPORTANT Check current disk free space - if it is 90% full, do not check out code to work on to make large new directories
  Be thoughtful and helpful, don't over do things
